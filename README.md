# .Net Core Command Explorer

## Intro

Recently, I came across [Summitech's Git explorer](https://github.com/summitech/gitexplorer). It is a really cool resource for anyone to easily figure out the best Git commands to use. I loved it, use it almost every day and decided to build something similar for .Net Core CLI.
